ONES SONiC Validated Designs


# Introduction 

SONiC, the open-source NOS, is one of the best examples of “Multi-Vendor Open-Source” software in networking, where multiple vendors, service providers, hyperscalers, and enterprises collaborate with the community and contribute to the future of open source networking .


Aviz Networks leads open-source networking via disaggregated support; providing cloud-native applications, and AI for multi-vendor network fabrics. Aviz enables SONiC deployments in data center & edge networks by delivering platform and ASIC agnostic, easy-to-use applications for network observability, orchestration, and assurance. Aviz is ensuring SONiC becomes a ubiquitous, accessible, and intelligent NOS for every stakeholder. Aviz is built on winning customer trust; to be the team you turn to for your Open, Cloud, AI-first network solutions. We intensely focus on making every step of your SONiC journey with us a success.

SONiC is an open source network operating system based on Linux that runs on merchant silicon-based platforms. It breaks monolithic switch soſtware into multiple containerized components; network operators can plug in new components, third-party, proprietary, or open sourced soſtware, with minimum effort, and tailor SONiC to their specific scenarios. Thus resulting in a much higher system availability where users can easily manage a variety of services.


# SONiC Advantages:

- Standardization of the NOS layer for control, flexibility, TCO savings, and in-house innovation 
- Supply chain diversification via a single software platform that runs across a multitude of hardware, including white-boxes
- Standardization of the NOS layer bringing uniformity in orchestration and NetOps
- Hardware agnostic NOS for the entire fabric reduces network complexities, improving operational efficiency
- Open platform that fosters collaboration among networking experts across the globe 
- Growing community of developers that includes hyperscalers, cloud providers, enterprises, startups, individuals, and hardware vendors
- Portability - Switch abstraction interfaces allows sonic to be ported to multiple vendor switch ASICs
- Containerization  - Container architecture allows upgrading of various services such as BGP with no data plane down time
- Scalability - Integrations with 3rd party offerings helps to automate and validate the overall data center networks 
- Visibility - Open source oriented network operating system and a visible source code without hidden security holes


# Day 1 Operations - Simplified by ONES

Aviz ONES simplifies the Day 1 orchestration with a unified approach of configuring data center fabric running SONiC. ONES collects the necessary fabric intent in a simplified YAML format, generates the unified configuration for each device managed. The generated configuration is applied, validated and verified for operational readiness. ONES provides the following advantages


- **Unified Fabric manager** platform for Network Admins across multi-vendor systems running SONiC
- **Single Click Interface** to Generate, Validate, Apply and Verify the Day 1 readiness of the Fabric
- Supports various **Fabric architectures** including Simple-L2-MC LAG, BGP-IP-CLOS, BGP-EVPN-L2-VXLAN, BGP-EVPN-L3-VXLAN.
- Simplified **Language agnostic APIs** for integration to existing NetOps tools for Day 1.
- **Open Data Models** using YAML templates for configuration and OpenConfig based for Monitoring.
- **Multi-vendor Orchestration** supporting both Hardware (ASIC/Switches) and Software (SONiC NOS - Community or Vendor).
