# <b>Why Migrate from Cumulus</b>

- Customers who have Broadcom based switches, do not have an upgrade path with Cumulus.
- Cumulus license prices have  increased considerably as it has become a  single vendor nvidia switch support model now which is not future proof for bringing  CapEx and OpEx down
- SONiC is readily supported on Cumulus enabled Platforms and uses the same routing stack (FRR)
