Aviz ONES simplifies the Day 1 orchestration with a unified approach of configuring data center fabric running SONiC. ONES collects the necessary fabric intent in a simplified YAML format, generates the unified configuration for each device managed. The generated configuration is applied, validated and verified for operational readiness. ONES provides the following advantages

* Unified Fabric manager platform for Network Admins across multi-vendor systems running SONiC
* Single Click Interface to Generate, Validate, Apply and Verify the Day 1 readiness of the Fabric
* Supports various Fabric architectures including Simple-L2-MC LAG, BGP-IP-CLOS, BGP-EVPN-L2-VXLAN, BGP-EVPN-L3-VXLAN.
* Simplified Language agnostic APIs for integration to existing NetOps tools for Day 1.
* Open Data Models using YAML templates for configuration and OpenConfig based for Monitoring.
* Multi-vendor Orchestration supporting both Hardware (ASIC/Switches) and Software (SONiC NOS - Community or Vendor).
