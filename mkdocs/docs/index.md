# Aviz - ONES Validated Designs and Netowork Copilot SDK

Welcome! This documentation hub introduces two powerful resources from Aviz Networks:

- **Aviz - ONES Validated Designs** — validated design and operational documentation for SONiC-based fabrics  
- **Network Copilot SDK (ncp-sdk)** — a developer toolkit for building AI-powered network agents

---

## What is Aviz - ONES Validated Designs?

**Aviz - ONES Validated Designs** is a comprehensive set of reference documentation, workflows, and operational guidance focused on deploying and managing **SONiC-based network fabrics** using Aviz’s ONES platform. It includes:

- Getting started with the SONiC journey  
- SONiC advantages and operational best practices  
- Day-1 and Day-2 operations for SONiC with ONES  
- SONiC deployment configurations and templates  
- Migration guides to SONiC from other NOS  
- REST APIs and automation capabilities  
- Aviz SONiC Ansible Collection  
- Deployment guidance and contact information :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What is the Network Copilot SDK?

The **Network Copilot SDK (ncp-sdk)** is a developer-focused framework that lets you build **AI/LLM-powered agents** for network automation and observability. Using this SDK, you can:

- Create custom agents to assist in troubleshooting, configuration, monitoring, and automation  
- Integrate directly with telemetry or operational APIs (e.g., ONES REST APIs)  
- Extend network workflows with intelligent insights and actions  
- Use sample agents and templates to accelerate development

Whether you’re building your first agent or scaling an agent ecosystem, the SDK provides the tools, guides, and examples you need.
