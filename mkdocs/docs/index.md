SONiC is an open source network operating system based on Linux that runs on merchant silicon-based platforms. It breaks monolithic switch soſtware into multiple containerized components; network operators can plug in new components, third-party, proprietary or open sourced soſtware with minimum effort and tailor SONiC to their specific scenarios , thus resulting in a much higher system availability where users can easily manage a variety of services.
