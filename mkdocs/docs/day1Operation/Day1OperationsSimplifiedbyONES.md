# <b>Day 1 Operations - Simplified by ONES</b>

Aviz ONES simplifies the Day 1 orchestration with an unified approach of configuring data center fabric running SONiC. ONES collects the necessary fabric intent in a simplified YAML format, generates the unified configuration for each device enrolled and managed by ONES . The generated configuration is applied, validated and verified for operational readiness. ONES provides the following advantages to network operation teams-




- **Unified Fabric manager** platform for Network Administrators  across multi-vendor system running SONiC enabled fabric
- **Single Click Interface** to Generate, Validate, Apply and Verify the Day 1 readiness of the Data Center Fabric
- Supports various **Fabric architectures** including BGP-IP-CLOS,  BGP-IP-CLOS-MC LAG , L2-VXLAN Asymmetric IRB over MC LAG,  L3-VXLAN Symmetric IRB over MC LAG 
- Simplified **Language agnostic REST APIs** for integration to existing NetOps tools for Day 1.
- **Open Data Models** used are YAML templates for configuration and OpenConfig , GNMI for Monitoring.
- **Multi-vendor Sonic Orchestration** supporting both Hardware (ASIC/Switches) and Software (SONiC NOS - Community or Vendor).
