# <b> Day 2 Operations for SONiC with ONES</b>
Day 2 Operations in Data center fabric involves monitoring the Network Fabric for health, anomalies and alerting . It also includes the maintenance of network devices due to failures or upgrades. 

<br />
Following  are some of the most critical operations done by Network Administrators  as  a part of  Day 2 Operations-

- Monitor Health for Data centers
- Alerting and Notification on Anomalies
- Troubleshooting Deployment Failures 
- Moving links and devices  in/out of the production fabric using BGP route-map
- Switch RMA due to hardware failures
- Image Upgrades for software fixes
- Version control for configurations applied 
- Ability to backup with “ configuration save” at any time instance and also after successful orchestration 
- Configure Restore - Operators can choose to restore to a particular version of configuration

ONES provides in-depth visibility of the network state in a multi-vendor data center environment  running SONiC. This includes a comprehensive  dashboard view for  both the point-in-time and time-series data for inventory, health, topology and traffic management . ONES include an in-built rule engine to notify alerts on anomalies and failures. 

For Data Center Operations maintenance, ONES provides clear abstraction to network operators through REST APIs and UIs for Day 2 operations like switch RMAs and image upgrades.
