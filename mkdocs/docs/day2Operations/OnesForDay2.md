# ONES for Day 2 operations

![img](../img/day2New.png)

ONES provides in-depth visibility of network state in a multi-vendor data center environment  running SONiC. This includes a comprehensive  dashboard view for  both the point-in-time and time-series data for inventory, health, topology and traffic management . ONES also has an in-built rule engine to notify alerts on anomalies and failures. For DCO maintenance, ONES provides clear abstraction to operators for the APIs and UIs for switch RMAs and image upgrades. ONES APIs can also be easily integrated into customerâ€™s  NetOps tools of their choice.
